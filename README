MiniBPM Android Simple Sample
=============================

This is a very trivial example Android application that uses the
MiniBPM tempo estimator.

This project serves as an example of how to link to, and call to,
MiniBPM from Java code in an Android application.

It is *not* an example of how to write an Android application! The
Android-specific Java code here is absolutely not something that you
should refer to in your own work. This is simply an illustration of
the use of the JNI (Android NDK) interface.

To build:

   $ ndk-build
   $ ant debug
   $ ant debug install

The example code is public domain; the MiniBPM licence is documented
separately (see http://www.breakfastquay.com/minibpm/).
