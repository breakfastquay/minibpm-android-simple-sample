MiniBPM Android Simple Sample
=============================

This is a very trivial example Android application that uses the
MiniBPM tempo estimator.

This project serves as an example of how to link to, and call to,
MiniBPM from Java code in an Android application.

It is *not* an example of how to write an Android application! The
Android-specific Java code here is absolutely not something that you
should refer to in your own work. This is simply an illustration of
the use of the JNI (Android NDK) interface.

In fact, the application has an empty user interface: all it does is
estimate the tempo of an audio file that is bundled into the app as a
resource, and send the results to the logger (use adb logcat to view).

To build:

   $ ndk-build
   $ ant debug
   $ ant debug install

The example code is public domain; the MiniBPM licence is documented
separately (see http://www.breakfastquay.com/minibpm/).
